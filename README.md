# RxFireAuth-Android

RxFireAuth is a wrapper around the [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) SDK that exposes most of the available functions through [RxKotlin](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxKotlin) objects. as well as improving the logic around managing and handling accounts throughout the lifecycle of your app.

Firebase Authentication is a great way to support user authentication in your app easily. This library builds on top of that to simplify even further the process with pre-built algorithms that support registering, logging-in, linking accounts with other providers, and more.

Looking for the iOS/iPadOS version? You can find it [right here](https://github.com/MrAsterisco/RxFireAuth).
